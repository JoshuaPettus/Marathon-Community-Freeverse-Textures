# Marathon-Community-Freeverse-Textures
These are the mml scripts and original textures (mostly PNG though some DDS) used by the Community Freeverse texture packages for Bungie's Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity.
The release packages are:

 - CFP Monsters - https://simplici7y.com/items/community-freeverse-plugin-monsters/
 - CFP Scenery - http://simplici7y.com/items/community-freeverse-plugin-scenery
 - CFP Weapons Inf - http://simplici7y.com/items/community-freeverse-plugin-weapons
 - CFP Weapons M2 - http://simplici7y.com/items/community-freeverse-plugin-weapons-m2
 - CFP Walls M2 - http://simplici7y.com/items/community-freeverse-plugin-walls-m2

# Notes
In order to be more efficient while in use, the release packages are batch converted by Aorta from PNG to DDS. As such the mml scripts are set to look for the DDS version of the textures.
Though if anyone wants to edit the files, here are the originals.  Unfortunately some of the originals (including a few items, weapons and the VacBoB sprites) are already DDS as those were what were given to me.

# Convert to DDS
The textures are set up to be batch converted by Aorta from PNG to DDS.  Normally in the batch conversion process merges the #A texture with the #A_glow texture to make a dds glow image used by the engine.
In Aorta, just check "Attempt to find mask" and search for ^A_glow$
